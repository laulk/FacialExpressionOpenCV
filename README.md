# FacialExpressionOpenCV
Final Year Project [Traditional Warping program]

To Run this program: you need everything listed in requirements_tps.txt file
Python 3

Once your virtualenv is setup with the pre-requisites simply turn on terminal/command line 

	python tps_gui.py
	OR
	python tps_slider.py

tps_gui.py is the standard implementation for transforming facial expressions from a neutral expression to a smiling expression, extended diversity features: face types/shape. Adjusting the severity of the smile only via repeatedly pressing any of the smile buttons

tps_slider.py is the second implementation with same functionality. Diversity function include a more sensitive slider mechanism to adjust severity or degree of smiling.

Also to note: the undo button is buggy (limitations of warping rather than actual bug)

Save-image button: broken no time to fix, & unimportant.
